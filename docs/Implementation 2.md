# Implementation Tasks
after updating the tasks, also update related tasks in PM docs/Project plan.md

To use this plan effectively:
1. Mark tasks as complete by changing [ ] to [x]
2. Update the Progress Tracking section as you move through phases
3. Add new subtasks as needed while maintaining the existing structure
4. Keep the Additional Considerations section updated with any new requirements or challenges
5. Don't delete existing content
